# CSO-Weapons
Weapons from Counter-Strike Online ported to Sven Co-op in Angelscript.

They'll be placed in their own separate folders for now.

They might not be the latest versions that I've made, but they are working releases  

There might be changes made to the game that cause the scripts to fail and there's nothing I can do about it at this time. 
But the fixes should be simple.
